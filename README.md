# Object Orientated Programming: Team profile generator
This team profile generator uses node.js and the Inquirer package so that a user can answer questions to generate a HTML file that shows profile of their team members. 

## User story 
As a manager, I want a quick and efficient way to create a HTML document that displays key information for employees on my team. 

##Â Usage 
To run this application, type 'node index.js' in the command line to run a number of prompts that will ask for information about you, as a manager, and your team. 

## Packages 
For this project I used the npm inquirer package, a collection of common interactive command line user interfaces.

## Project status
